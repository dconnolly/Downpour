Downpour v0.1
-------------
Created by Jeremy Jongsma (jeremy@jongsma.org)

DEPENDENCIES (tested version):

	- python-twisted (8.2.0)
	- python-libtorrent (0.14.2)
	- python-feedparser (4.1)
	- python-dateutil (1.4.1)

INSTALLATION (Linux/Unix/BSD):

	1.	Copy src/downpour somewhere in your PYTHONPATH
	2.	Copy src/downpourd to /usr/bin/downpourd
	3.	Copy cfg/downpour.cfg to /etc/downpour.cfg and customize it
	4.	Copy html to /usr/share/downpour/html

	Downpour has not yet been tested on Windows.

STARTING DOWNPOUR:

	To start the downpour daemon, run the following command:

		downpourd -c [config-file]
	
	(Note: the daemon does not run on Windows yet; Windows
	users can only launch it in debug mode (see below).  If
	anyone wants to create a real launcher for Windows,
	please email it to me at jeremy@jongsma.org.)

	When launching as root, you can specify the user or group to
	run as with "--user" and "--group". Specifying a user or
	group on the command line is unncessary if you have already
	specfied one in downpour.cfg, since Downpour will
	automatically drop privileges after setup (useful if you
	want to use port 80 for the web interface.) User and group
	options are not available on Windows.

	Run "downpourd --help" to view additional runtime options.
		
	You can access the web interface at http://localhost:6280
	(or whatever address/port you configured in downpour.cfg.)
	The default login is "admin" / "password".  You can
	change the admin password in "My Account" once logged in,
	or setup additional users in the "Users" section.

STOPPING DOWNPOUR:

	To stop the daemon, run the following command:

		downpourd stop
	
	It may take a few seconds to stop while it cleanly closes
	all bittorrent connections.

DEBUGGING DOWNPOUR:

	To prevent Downpour from detaching from the console (and
	to view debugging messages), run the following command:

		downpourd -c [config-file] -d
	
	This is currently the only way to run Downpour on Windows.

HACKING ON DOWNPOUR:

	Edit the code in src/downpour.  You can immediately view your
	changes by running ./downpour-debug.sh in the current directory.
